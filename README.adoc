= CodeRAD

An MVC, Rapid-Application-Development library for Codename One

== Project Status

This project is at an early stage but there are already a handful of polished components that can be incorporated into Codename One apps today.

== Features

. *Reusable Components* - Facilitates the creation of View components that can be easily reused across projects without requiring any dependencies.
. *Rich UI Components* - Components built with CodeRAD are richer than the standard Codename One UI components.  They are designed to be useful right out of the box, while still being customizable.
. *Clean Separation of Code* - Provides model, view, and controller classes which facilitate the clean separation of code following MVC (Model-View-Controller) principles.
. *Loose Coupling* - Views can be "loosely" coupled to their model, allowing them to be used with many different model classes. 
. *Declarative Java UI Syntax* - Introduces a flexible declarative syntax for describing user interfaces, in pure Java.
.. Generate forms (for editing entities) using declarative syntax, and less code.

. *https://shannah.github.io/CodeRAD/javadoc/com/codename1/rad/ui/entityviews/ProfileAvatarsTitleComponent.html[ProfileAvatarsTitleComponent]* - A component that displays a number of ProfileAvatarViews in a "fan" layout (i.e. like BoxLayout.X_AXIS, except that it will "fan them out" with overlap if there isn't enough space for everything).  This is used as the form's title component for the https://github.com/shannah/RADChatRoom[RADChatRoom] component.
